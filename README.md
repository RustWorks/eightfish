# EightFish

What is EightFish?

EightFish is a Web MVC framework to deveop decentralized application.

Deeply, EightFish is a development framework (maybe the first one) for the Open Data Application (ODA), implementing the Open Data Application Model (ODAM). You can think of ODA is a type of data-kind decentralized application of Web3. The theory of ODA and ODAM is located [here](https://medium.com/@daogangtang/the-road-to-open-web-b684879a5571). In a short description: EightFish powers ODAs, ODAs constitute the OpenWeb, which is a subset of Web3.

EightFish makes devs to develop a decentralized application in Web2 development style, rather than the smart contract style. Unlike the smart contract blockchain tech stack most DApps adopt, EightFish makes your own network, a sovereign network which doesn't rely on any other Web3 layers or services.

By some elaberate designs, EightFish reaches the experiences of Web2/Internet web development, but for the OpenWeb/Web3 decentralized application.

NOTICE: EightFish itself is not a service/platform/serverless/layer, it is just a dev framework tool.

## Get Started

You can read the [EightFish Book](https://eightfish-org.github.io/eightfish-book/) to learn how to get started.

## Status

The status is before Alpha, we are working on one use case of this:

- [GUTP](https://github.com/eightfish-org/gutp): A General User Text Persistence protocol, built using EightFish
- [Discux](https://github.com/miketang84/discux): A forum system (including backend and frontend) connected to GUTP. 

Soon you will get a concrete picture that how EightFish works.

## Docker and Tests

If you want to compile EightFish step by step, please follow steps in the [docker doc](https://github.com/eightfish-org/eightfish/blob/master/docs/docker.md) to build and test.
