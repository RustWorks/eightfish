# EightFish

What is EightFish?

EightFish is a development framework (maybe the first one) for the Open Data Application (ODA), implementing the Open Data Application Model (ODAM). The theory of the ODA and ODAM is located [here](https://medium.com/@daogangtang/the-road-to-open-web-b684879a5571). In short description: EightFish powers ODAs, ODAs constitute the Open Web.

Concretely, EightFish(8fish) is a framework to develop a decentralized application in Web2 development style.

Unlike the smart contract blockchain tech stack most DApps adopt, EightFish makes your own network, a sovereign network which doesn't rely on any other Web3 layers or services.

By some elaberate designs, EightFish reaches the experiences of Web2/Internet web development, but for OpenWeb/Web3 decentralized application.

Note: EightFish itself is not a service/platform/serverless, it is just a dev framework tool.
