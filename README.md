# EightFish

EightFish(8fish) is a framework to develop a decentralized application in Web2 development style.

Unlike the smart contract blockchain tech stack most DApps adopt, EightFish makes your own network, a sovereign network which doesn't reply on any other Web3 layers or services.

By some elaberate designs, EightFish reaches the experiences of Web2/Internet web development, but for OpenWeb/Web3 decentralized application.

Currently this project is under heavily coded, the status is before alpha-releasing.

Note: EightFish itself is not a service/platform/serverless, it is just a dev framework tool.
